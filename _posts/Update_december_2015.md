### So What's been going on?

Well long story short: Time. Creating a new distro; whether from scratch or based upon an already mature ecosystem is; well **Hard**. It is definitely not as easy as we had initially thought and has its own challenges, especially when you're highly dependant on other projects. We have had quite a lot of setbacks in the past two months, we expected (or should I say *Wanted*) to have working images or atleast screenshots of Ariel in action. These setbacks were mostly because because of a betrayal (more on this later) and because some packages that we needed were broken in the newest daily builds of Ubuntu 16.04 itself.

### Whats happening now.

Well, **A Lot** has been happening. Just to scratch the surface our two icon themes, [Pinbadge](https://github.com/Pinbadge/pinbadge-linux-theme) and [Cocoa](https://github.com/libredeb/cocoa-icon-theme) are going along very, *very* nicely. We are also working on our gnome based DE 'Ariel' and our waiting for the amazing elementary's gala-wm to stabilize a little bit.

### Whats ahead.

A very difficult, long road ahead until our v1 release. We still don't have a good GTK+ theme, which is a major setback, we need to start working on our own apps and start to rely less on other mainstream projects. We have a long list of TO-DO's and we don't want to ignore any one of them.
