title: Monthly Update 2 - Happy New Year!
---

oops. We'ere late. But we're here. First off, we wish you a very Happy New Year! We've done a lot of things this past month and we're eager to let you know.

# Images!
Yes images. Real working ISO's that actually boot and login... well thats about it unfortunately. The desktop is usable but it's not a sight to behold thanks to an upstream bug with Ubuntu 16.04, which is understandable.

Yeah. Once this is sorted out we'll be one more step closer to an alpha release!

# Themes
Sweet. We now have a new icon theme and a new designer on the team! Fabian Inostroza. You may know him for his work on the amazing El-General Icon theme. Gtk isn't going so sweet though.

Our [Website](http://arelos.github.io) has also been slightly revamped in looks and CSS and HTML code has been sortof *cleaned*

We're coming. Soon. Stay Tuned folks.
